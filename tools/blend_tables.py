"""Write the 'all hits' gameplay blends for the early-modern and musket-era tables.

all hits = (1 - k) x wounded table + k x killed table, location by location, where k is
the share of hits that killed outright. Where no region counts of a war's killed survive,
the Civil War killed-in-action table (1,173 men, soft lead balls) stands in for them; where
no wounded records survive (the Thirty Years' War), the Peninsular War records stand in.
Run from the project root after changing a source table:  python tools/blend_tables.py
